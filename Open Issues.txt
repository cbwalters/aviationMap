To Do

	Tower Name/Frequency in airport info

	Longest runway in airport info
		How to choose from joins that return multiple rows?
			-Perhaps this is possible via "relations"

	Prioritize airport information display on some metric
		Controlled
		Number of ops

	Proper per-segment information for airways (enroute altitudes etc)

	Can you resize text so label is small but visible up to maximum size?

	Put in a runway for airports that don't have lat/lon of theirs

	VOR background
		Works except for rotation of numbers

	RCO info on VORs
		There but needs to be filtered a bit

	MSA for grid area (Have MORA but that's higher)

	Some topo information

	Cite and Acknowledge if used
		SRTM
